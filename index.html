<h4>What If you could change the world as you see fit</h4>
<p>While it's true to life that we all wish we could manipulate the structure of this world.<br>
  Giving any person the power of such perportions could spell the end for many individuals.<br>
  One with such power could make that specific person a god in their own right.<br>
  A mortal is never meant to wield the abilities to manipulate the natural world.<br>
  such power should only be left to imagination.</p>

<p>That being said, what if YOU held the power of god?<br>
  Would your make your rivals bow down? Would you hide them in fear of the world trying to catch you?<br>
  What you would do is between you and your imagination, unless you decide to share with friends.<br>
  After all... this is just a site to get you to consider the impossible,<br>
  but is this kind of power impossible to obtain?<br>
  What if...</p>
